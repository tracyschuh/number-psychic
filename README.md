# number-psychic
This application is a game in which my code quesses your number. A tally of guesses is provided so the user can see how many guesses it took to arrive at the correct answer. I love math and so this was a fun project for me. I also enjoy CSS animations and created a 'burning' header to add to the magical effect of the application.

A live demo can be found <a href="https://tracyschuh.com/number_psychic/number_pyschic.html">here</a>.
